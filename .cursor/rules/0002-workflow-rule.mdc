## When user starts a new conversation
  1. Read `PROJECT_ROOT/memory_bank/long_term.md` file to get the context of the project.
  2. Generate a workflow name (under 10 words, snake case).
  3. Then, create file `PROJECT_ROOT/memory_bank/wf_{workflow_name}`. The content must have the following sections:
   - Current tasks from user prompt.
   - Plan (simple): your plan & thoughts to solve task(s).
   - Steps: break your plan into small steps.
   - Things done
   - Things not done yet

## In a cycle of current conversation
  1. Read current `PROJECT_ROOT/memory_bank/wf_{workflow_name}` file. Don't be lazy, don't omit any content.
  2. Update plan and steps if needed, based on the current state.
  3. After you finish a task, update `Things done` and `Things not done yet` to track your work.
