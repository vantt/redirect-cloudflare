## Epic 7 — Epic Review Discussion (Step 4)

Facilitator: Bob (Scrum Master)

Scope: Reflect on Epic 7 execution to surface successes, challenges, and insights. Grounded in story records 7.1–7.7 and repo docs.

Context Snapshot
- Stories done: 7/7 (7.1–7.7)
- Key artifacts: `docs/tech-spec-epic-7.md`, story files 7.1–7.7, `docs/architecture.md`
- Noted discrepancies: Some story checklists indicate pending sub-tasks (timeouts/logging), while sprint-status marks all Done. Confirm status below.

1) Successes and Strengths (initial synthesis)
- Clear abstraction boundary: neutral `AnalyticsEvent` and `AnalyticsProvider` (Story 7.2)
- Router fan-out designed to isolate provider failures (Story 7.3)
- Registry via `ANALYTICS_PROVIDERS` enables environment-driven toggles (Story 7.4)
- Structured logging plan captured (Story 7.6); observability emphasis
- Test harness and provider mocks planned to validate success/failure/timeout (Story 7.7)

Questions for team
- Which practice most improved delivery (e.g., isolation via router, env-driven registry)?
- Any story where the approach worked exceptionally well? Which and why?

2) Challenges and Growth Areas (initial synthesis)
- Timeout enforcement and non-blocking guarantees show mixed signals (Story 7.5 tasks vs. status Done)
- Logging schema consistency and PII redaction need confirmation
- Potential drift between docs and code for router/timeout implementation details

Questions for team
- What made timeout/logging challenging? Any recurring pattern we should address?
- Where did process friction occur (handoffs, reviews, test setup)?

3) Insights and Learning (initial prompts)
- Abstraction first simplified GA4 integration planning (Epic 8)
- Strict interfaces reduced vendor coupling

Questions for team
- What insight should we carry into Epic 8 implementation?
- Any skill or tooling that would accelerate next epic setup?

Team Input (please respond inline or in reply)
- Biggest win of Epic 7:
- Top challenge and root cause:
- One change we should try next epic:

Status Confirmations Requested
- Are timeout (2s) and non-blocking behavior implemented and verified? (y/n + notes)
- Is structured logging emitting the agreed schema without PII? (y/n + notes)
- Any known technical debt to log now? (list)

Notes
- After team feedback, facilitator will synthesize items into Step 6 action plan and Step 7 readiness.
