## Task: 1.4.4 Add Monitoring Alerts (Placeholder)

**Description:**
Identify critical error conditions (e.g., high rate of 500 errors, specific error codes) that should trigger monitoring alerts. This task is primarily planning/documentation at this stage, with implementation deferred to Phase 3.

**Source Task:**
docs/project-plan/implementation.md -> Phase 1 -> 1.4 Error Handling -> Add monitoring alerts

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Review existing error handling (400s, 500s).
- Identify critical errors that warrant immediate attention via alerts:
    - Unexpected exceptions caught by the top-level handler (leading to 500s).
    - Potentially high rates of specific 4xx errors if they indicate a systemic issue (e.g., sudden spike in `INVALID_URL` might mean broken link generation elsewhere).
    - Failures in critical external dependencies (e.g., KV store access, future tracking service calls).
- Document these critical error conditions and the desired alerting thresholds (e.g., "> X errors per minute", "any 5xx error").
- Research potential Cloudflare monitoring/alerting integrations (e.g., Cloudflare Health Checks, Logpush to external monitoring systems like Datadog, Sentry). *Note: Actual integration is Phase 3.4.*

**TDD Approach:**
- Not applicable (Planning/Documentation task).

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  Review code (`src/index.ts`, `src/errors.ts`) and error types (`src/constants.ts`).
2.  Create/update a section in a relevant design document (or this task file itself) listing critical error scenarios:
    *   **Critical:** Any unhandled exception resulting in 500 Internal Server Error. (Alert immediately).
    *   **Warning:** Sustained high rate (> Y/min) of 400 Bad Request errors (e.g., `INVALID_URL`, `REDIRECT_LOOP_DETECTED`). (Investigate).
    *   **Future:** Errors related to KV access failures.
    *   **Future:** Errors related to Tracking Integration failures (Phase 2).
3.  Briefly research Cloudflare monitoring options:
    *   Worker Metrics: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/metrics/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/metrics/)
    *   Alerting on Metrics: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/alerts/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/alerts/) (or via integrated monitoring platforms)
    *   Logpush: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/)
4.  Document findings and decisions within this task file or a central monitoring plan document.

**Related Design & Specifications:**
- [Main Technical Design](../../../technical-design/DESIGN.md): Entry point for overall technical design.
- [Infrastructure](../../../technical-design/infrastructure.md): Mentions platform capabilities (e.g., metrics).
- [Future Considerations](../../../technical-design/future_considerations.md): May outline monitoring/alerting plans.

**Dependencies:**
- Error logging implemented (Task 1.4.2) as a basis for alerts.
- Basic understanding of monitoring concepts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Critical error conditions for alerting are identified and documented.
- Potential monitoring/alerting tools/strategies (within Cloudflare or external) are researched and noted.
- Plan exists for implementing actual alerts in Phase 3.
