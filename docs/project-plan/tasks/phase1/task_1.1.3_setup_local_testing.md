## Task: 1.1.3 Set Up Local Testing Infrastructure

**Description:**
Implement a testing framework (e.g., Vitest, Jest) configured to work with Cloudflare Workers, enabling unit and integration tests for the worker code locally.

**Source Task:**
docs/project-plan/implementation.md -> Phase 1 -> 1.1 Basic Worker Setup -> Set up local testing infrastructure

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Choose and install a testing framework suitable for Cloudflare Workers (Vitest is often recommended due to its compatibility with Workers' environment).
- Configure the framework to handle Worker-specific APIs and environment (e.g., using `vitest-environment-miniflare` or similar).
- Create a basic test file (e.g., `src/index.test.ts`) with a sample test case for the initial fetch handler.
- Add test script(s) to `package.json` (e.g., `"test": "vitest"`, `"test:watch": "vitest --watch"`).

**TDD Approach:**

*   **Test Cases (for the testing setup):**
    *   Write a simple test that imports the main worker handler (`src/index.ts`).
    *   Write a test that simulates a basic `fetch` event and asserts the expected default response (e.g., "Hello Worker!" from the starter template).
    *   Verify that the test runner executes these tests successfully.
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  Install Vitest and necessary environment simulators: `npm install --save-dev vitest vitest-environment-miniflare miniflare @cloudflare/workers-types`. (Note: `miniflare` provides the local simulation).
    2.  Configure Vitest: Create `vitest.config.ts` at the project root. Set the environment to `miniflare` and configure module resolution if needed.
        ```typescript
        // vitest.config.ts
        import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

        export default defineConfig({
          test: {
            environment: 'miniflare',
            environmentOptions: {
              // Miniflare options go here
              scriptPath: './src/index.ts', // Adjust if your entry point is different
              modules: true,
            },
          },
        })
        ```
    3.  Add test scripts to `package.json`: `"test": "vitest run"`, `"test:watch": "vitest"`
    4.  Create a test file `src/index.test.ts`.
    5.  Write the basic tests described above (import handler, simulate fetch, assert response).
    6.  Run `npm test` to execute the tests.
