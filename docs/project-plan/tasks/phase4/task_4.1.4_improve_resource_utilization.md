## Task: 4.1.4 Improve Resource Utilization

**Description:**
Optimize the worker's use of resources, primarily focusing on CPU time and memory usage, to ensure efficiency and cost-effectiveness, especially under load.

**Source Task:**
docs/project-plan/implementation.md -> Phase 4 -> 4.1 Performance Tuning -> Improve resource utilization

**Detailed Specifications:**
- **CPU Time:** Directly related to Task 4.1.1. Reducing algorithmic complexity, avoiding unnecessary computations, and efficient use of APIs (like Cache API, `waitUntil`) directly reduces CPU time.
- **Memory Usage:**
    - Avoid loading large datasets or libraries into memory unnecessarily.
    - Be mindful of storing large amounts of data in global variables for in-worker caching (Task 4.1.3); ensure it fits within Worker memory limits.
    - Stream responses where possible if dealing with large data generation (less likely for a redirector, but good practice).
    - Analyze bundle size (`wrangler publish --dry-run --outdir dist` or similar). Large bundles can impact startup time and potentially memory. Remove unused dependencies or consider code splitting if applicable (though less common/easy in basic Workers).
- **Subrequests:** Minimize the number of subrequests needed to serve a request, as each consumes resources. Use caching (Task 4.1.2) effectively.

**TDD Approach:**
- Unit tests ensure correctness. Resource optimization is primarily verified through monitoring and load testing.
*   **Verification:**
    *   Monitor CPU Time metrics (Task 3.4.1).
    *   Monitor Memory Usage metrics (Available on paid plans: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/metrics/#memory-usage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/metrics/#memory-usage)). If on free plan, rely on keeping code/dependencies lean.
    *   Monitor Subrequest counts (Task 3.4.1).
    *   Perform load testing (e.g., using k6, Artillery, or Cloudflare tools) to observe resource usage under stress.

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  Revisit CPU optimizations from Task 4.1.1.
2.  Review code for large static data or libraries being loaded.
3.  If using in-worker global caching, estimate the potential memory footprint.
4.  Analyze bundle size. Run `npm prune` or similar to remove unused dependencies. Investigate large dependencies.
5.  Ensure caching (Cache API) is used effectively to minimize redundant computations or subrequests.
6.  Perform load testing against a staging environment.
7.  Monitor resource metrics (CPU, Memory if available, Subrequests) during load testing and in production.
8.  Refine code/architecture based on findings.

**Dependencies:**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CPU usage is minimized through efficient code and asynchronous operations.
- Memory usage is within reasonable limits (verified by metrics if available, or by lean code/dependencies otherwise).
- Bundle size is analyzed and kept reasonable.
- Resource utilization remains acceptable under load testing.
