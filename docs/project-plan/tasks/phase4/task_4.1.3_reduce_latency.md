## Task: 4.1.3 Reduce Latency

**Description:**
Analyze overall request latency (time from request received by Cloudflare edge to response sent) and identify contributing factors beyond worker processing time, such as network latency for subrequests or DNS lookups.

**Source Task:**
docs/project-plan/implementation.md -> Phase 4 -> 4.1 Performance Tuning -> Reduce latency

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Review end-to-end latency, potentially using Cloudflare logs (if enabled with timing fields) or external monitoring tools that measure full response time.
- Differentiate between Worker execution time (Task 4.1.1) and other latency sources.
- **Subrequest Latency:**
    - If server-side tracking calls (Task 3.1.2) are implemented and *not* using `ctx.waitUntil`, they will add directly to latency. Ensure they are asynchronous.
    - Analyze the duration of KV reads/writes if used extensively. Consider caching frequently accessed KV data within the worker instance (global variable) if latency is high.
- **Geographic Latency:** Workers run close to the user, minimizing this, but subrequests to origin servers or external APIs might introduce geographic latency. Consider if external APIs have regional endpoints.
- **Cold Starts:** Analyze Worker startup time (cold start vs. warm start) using Cloudflare metrics. While hard to eliminate entirely, ensure code is efficient to minimize cold start impact. Consider paid plans for reduced cold starts if necessary.

**TDD Approach:**
- Not directly applicable to external latency factors. Focus on optimizing subrequests within the worker code.
*   **Verification:**
    *   Monitor Cloudflare Worker metrics for Subrequest counts and durations.
    *   Monitor end-to-end latency using external tools or detailed Cloudflare logs.
    *   Verify critical subrequests (like external tracking APIs) are wrapped in `ctx.waitUntil`.

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  Analyze end-to-end latency data (Cloudflare logs, external monitoring).
2.  Analyze Worker subrequest metrics (count, duration).
3.  Ensure all non-essential external API calls (tracking) are made asynchronously using `ctx.waitUntil`.
4.  If KV access is frequent and slow, implement in-worker caching for KV data (e.g., using a global variable, potentially with a short TTL mechanism if data changes).
5.  Review cold start metrics. Optimize worker initialization code if identified as a significant factor.
6.  Monitor latency metrics after changes to verify improvement.

**Dependencies:**
- Task 3.1.2 (Server-side tracking implementation - affects subrequests)
- Task 3.4.1 (Performance Monitoring)
- Access to detailed Cloudflare logs or external monitoring tools.
- Task 4.1.1 / 4.1.2 completed (optimization steps may impact latency).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Non-essential subrequests are made asynchronously.
- Latency contributions from KV or other dependencies are understood and potentially optimized (e.g., via in-worker caching).
- Overall request latency is monitored and meets requirements where possible.
