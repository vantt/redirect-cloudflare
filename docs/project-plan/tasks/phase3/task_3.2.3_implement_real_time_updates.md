## Task: 3.2.3 Implement Real-time Updates (Placeholder)

**Description:**
Configure the dashboard for real-time or near real-time data updates, if supported by the chosen tool and data source.

**Source Task:**
docs/project-plan/implementation.md -> Phase 3 -> 3.2 Dashboard Development -> Implement real-time updates

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Review the capabilities of the dashboarding tool (e.g., Cloudflare Dashboards) regarding auto-refresh intervals.
- Configure the dashboard's refresh interval to a suitable value (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes) for near real-time monitoring.
- Note limitations: True real-time might depend on Analytics Engine data ingestion latency.

**TDD Approach:**
- Not applicable (UI Configuration task).

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  Navigate to the dashboard created in Task 3.2.2.
2.  Locate the dashboard settings for refresh intervals.
3.  Set the desired auto-refresh interval (e.g., "1m").
4.  Save the dashboard settings.
5.  Observe the dashboard over a period to ensure it refreshes automatically.

**Dependencies:**
- Task 3.2.2 (Dashboard components created)
- Tasks 3.2.1 & 3.2.2 completed (dashboard exists).
- Data source allowing real-time feeds.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard is configured with an appropriate auto-refresh interval.
- Dashboard automatically updates data periodically.
