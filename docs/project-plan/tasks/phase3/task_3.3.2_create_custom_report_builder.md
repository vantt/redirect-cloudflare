## Task: 3.3.2 Create Custom Report Builder (Placeholder/Design)

**Description:**
Design a potential feature allowing users (likely administrators) to build custom reports by selecting dimensions and metrics, potentially via a simple UI or API.

**Source Task:**
docs/project-plan/implementation.md -> Phase 3 -> 3.3 Reporting Features -> Create custom report builder

**Detailed Specifications:**
- This is likely a complex feature, potentially a separate application or integration.
- **High-Level Design Options:**
    - **Option A (API-Driven):** Expose an authenticated API endpoint (maybe on the worker or a separate service) that accepts report parameters (dimensions, metrics, filters, time range) and returns data queried from Analytics Engine/Logpush source. A separate UI would call this API.
    - **Option B (Enhanced Dashboard):** Leverage advanced features of a dashboarding tool (like Grafana) that allows users some level of query customization or variable selection to build ad-hoc views.
    - **Option C (Direct SQL Access):** Grant trusted users direct (read-only) access to query the Analytics Engine dataset via SQL API or other tools.
- **Decision:** Defer implementation. If needed, **Option B (Enhanced Dashboard)** is the most feasible starting point using existing tools. Option A/C significantly increase scope.
- Document the potential need and the deferred approach.

**TDD Approach:**
- Not applicable (Design/Deferral task).

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  Acknowledge the requirement for custom reporting.
2.  Evaluate the complexity vs. business need.
3.  Document the decision to defer implementation and the preferred future approach (e.g., "Utilize advanced dashboard filtering/variable features first, consider custom API/UI later if required.").

**Technical References:**
- (Depends on chosen approach - API frameworks, dashboard tool docs)

**Dependencies:**
- Clear requirement from stakeholders for custom report building capabilities beyond standard dashboards.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Need for a custom report builder is evaluated.
- Decision on implementation approach and timing (e.g., deferral) is documented.
