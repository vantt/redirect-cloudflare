## Task: 3.3.3 Implement Data Export (Placeholder/Design)

**Description:**
Design or investigate methods for exporting raw or aggregated analytics data (e.g., as CSV) for offline analysis.

**Source Task:**
docs/project-plan/implementation.md -> Phase 3 -> 3.3 Reporting Features -> Implement data export

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Identify data export needs: Raw events vs. aggregated summaries? Specific time ranges or dimensions?
- Investigate export capabilities of the chosen data store/dashboarding tool:
    - **Analytics Engine:** Can data be exported via SQL API clients or potentially UI? (Check Cloudflare docs).
    - **Logpush:** Data is already exported to the configured destination (S3, GCS, etc.). Access controls are managed there.
    - **Dashboard Tools:** Many tools (Grafana, Cloudflare Dashboards) allow exporting data from specific panels as CSV.
- **Decision:** Rely on dashboard panel export features or direct access to Logpush destination / Analytics Engine SQL API as the primary methods. Defer building a custom export API endpoint unless strictly necessary.

**TDD Approach:**
- Not applicable (Design/Planning task).

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  Clarify specific data export requirements (what data, what format, frequency).
2.  Investigate and document the export capabilities of Analytics Engine (SQL API access) and the chosen dashboard tool (panel export).
3.  Document the recommended procedure for users needing to export data (e.g., "Use the 'Export CSV' option on the relevant dashboard panel" or "Query Analytics Engine directly using SQL API").

**Technical References:**
- Cloudflare Analytics Engine SQL API: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-api/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-api/)
- (Dashboard tool documentation on data export)

**Dependencies:**
- Task 3.1.4 (Tracking Analytics Design - chosen data store)
- Task 3.2.2 (Dashboard potentially used for export)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Data export requirements are understood.
- Available export methods (via tools or APIs) are identified and documented.
- Procedure for users to export data is documented.
