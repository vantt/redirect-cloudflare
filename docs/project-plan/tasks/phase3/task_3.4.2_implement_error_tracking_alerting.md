## Task: 3.4.2 Implement Error Tracking (Alerting)

**Description:**
Configure actual monitoring alerts based on the critical error conditions identified in Task 1.4.4, using Cloudflare's alerting features or integration with an external system.

**Source Task:**
docs/project-plan/implementation.md -> Phase 3 -> 3.4 Monitoring Tools -> Implement error tracking

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Based on the critical errors documented in Task 1.4.4 (e.g., any 5xx, high rate of 4xx).
- **Option A (Cloudflare Alerts):**
    - Configure Cloudflare Logs Alerts based on Worker logs or metrics.
    - Create rules like:
        - "If Worker Execution Status = 'error' count > 0 in 1 minute, alert PagerDuty/Email".
        - "If Worker Logs match `[ERROR_CODE_INVALID_URL]` count > 100 in 5 minutes, alert Slack".
- **Option B (External System Alerts):**
    - If using Logpush to Datadog/Splunk etc., configure alerts within that external system based on log queries or metrics derived from logs.
- **Decision:** Attempt **Option A (Cloudflare Alerts)** first, using Worker execution status for 5xx errors and log-based alerts for specific error codes/rates if possible. Fall back to Option B if needed.
- Set up Notification Integrations in Cloudflare (Account Home -> Notifications -> Destinations).
- Create Notification Rules (Account Home -> Notifications) linked to the desired metrics/log patterns and notification destinations.

**TDD Approach:**
- Not applicable (UI/Infrastructure Configuration). Manual testing required.
*   **Manual Testing:**
    *   Temporarily modify worker code to force a 5xx error (e.g., throw an unhandled exception). Verify the corresponding alert triggers and sends a notification to the configured destination.
    *   Generate a high rate of specific 4xx errors (e.g., invalid URLs). Verify the rate-based alert triggers.
    *   Restore original worker code after testing.

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  Review critical errors and thresholds from Task 1.4.4.
2.  In Cloudflare Dashboard:
    *   Go to Notifications -> Destinations -> Add Destination (e.g., Email, PagerDuty, Slack). Configure as needed.
    *   Go to Notifications -> Create.
    *   Select Product: "Workers".
    *   Configure alert based on metric (e.g., "Invocation Status=error", count > 0) or logs (e.g., match pattern `ERROR_CODE_INVALID_URL`, count > threshold). Set thresholds and time windows.
    *   Link to the created Notification Destination.
    *   Name and save the Notification.
3.  Repeat step 2 for different critical error conditions.
4.  Manually trigger error conditions (carefully, perhaps in staging) to test alert firing.

- [Infrastructure](../../../technical-design/infrastructure.md): Platform's alerting capabilities (based on logs/metrics).
- [Future Considerations](../../../technical-design/future_considerations.md): May define specific alerting rules.

**Dependencies:**
- Task 1.4.2 completed (error logging implemented).
- Task 3.4.1 completed (performance/error metrics available).
- Access to configure Cloudflare alerts or external tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Cloudflare Notification Destinations are configured.
- Cloudflare Notification rules are created for critical error conditions (5xx, high rate 4xx).
- Alerts successfully trigger and send notifications during manual testing.
