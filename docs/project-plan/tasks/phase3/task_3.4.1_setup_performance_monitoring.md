## Task: 3.4.1 Set up Performance Monitoring

**Description:**
Utilize Cloudflare Worker metrics and potentially the dashboard (from 3.2) to monitor key performance indicators like CPU time, execution time, and request latency.

**Source Task:**
docs/project-plan/implementation.md -> Phase 3 -> 3.4 Monitoring Tools -> Set up performance monitoring

**Detailed Specifications:**
- Review standard Worker metrics available in the Cloudflare dashboard (Analytics -> Workers).
- Key metrics:
    - Requests
    - CPU Time (P50, P90, P99)
    - Execution Time (Wall Time - P50, P90, P99)
    - Errors (5xx, 4xx)
- Add relevant performance charts to the custom dashboard (Task 3.2.2) if not already covered by standard Cloudflare views and if Analytics Engine captures relevant data (e.g., custom timing metrics). *Note: Standard CPU/Wall time isn't directly available in Analytics Engine.*
- Define acceptable performance thresholds based on non-functional requirements (e.g., sub-5ms target from specs - monitor P99 CPU/Execution time).

**TDD Approach:**
- Not applicable (Monitoring setup/review).

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  Navigate to the Cloudflare Dashboard -> Workers & Pages -> Select Worker -> Analytics.
2.  Familiarize yourself with the available charts (Requests, Errors, CPU Time, Invocation Status, Subrequests).
3.  Review the non-functional requirements (especially target response/processing time).
4.  Establish baseline performance after initial deployment and load.
5.  (Optional) If custom timing metrics were added to Analytics Engine, add visualizations for these to the custom dashboard (Task 3.2.2).
6.  Document where to monitor key performance metrics (Cloudflare dashboard vs. custom dashboard) and the target thresholds.

**Technical References:**
- Worker Metrics: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/metrics/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/metrics/)

**Dependencies:**
- Worker deployed and handling traffic.
- Task 3.2.2 (Custom dashboard, optional for this task).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Key performance metrics (CPU, Wall time, Requests) are identified in Cloudflare analytics.
- Performance thresholds based on requirements are documented.
- Procedure for monitoring performance is established.
