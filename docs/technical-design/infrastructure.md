## Infrastructure
- Cloudflare Workers platform: Leverages edge computing for low latency.
- Edge computing network: Ensures global availability and performance (supports 100k+ daily requests, 100% uptime target).
- KV storage: Potentially used for configuration or short-term state (Note: Original spec focuses on URL structure, not mappings).
- Global CDN: Assists with asset delivery if any UI components are added (e.g., error pages).
