# Epic 3 Retrospective — Legacy Client Bootstrap

Date: 2025-10-25
Facilitator: Bob (Scrum Master)

Epic: Epic 3 — Legacy Client Bootstrap
Status: Complete (2/2 stories done)

## What Went Well
- Clear coverage of legacy URL upgrade paths ensured compatibility
- E2E tests made behavior verifiable and stable

## What Could Improve
- Earlier alignment with security validation would reduce rework for upgrade logic
- Document edge cases (malformed fragments, encoding) prior to test writing

## Key Lessons Learned
1. Capture legacy URL patterns explicitly in PRD/Architecture for traceability
2. Pair testing with bootstrap implementation to minimize regressions
3. Keep default fallback behavior documented and tested

## Action Items (Owners)
- Add explicit legacy mapping table to docs/architecture.md (SM/Dev)
- Consolidate encoding utilities for URL handling (Dev)
- Add CI timing checks for bootstrap flow (<50ms) (Dev)

## Next Epic Preparation
- Dependencies: none blocking; debug/logging (Epic 5) will increase observability
- Gaps: ensure validation (Epic 6) aligns with bootstrap behavior
- Critical Path: finalize validation flow (6.1–6.3) before enabling broader tracking

## Metrics
- Stories Planned: 2
- Stories Done: 2
- Blockers: none persisted
