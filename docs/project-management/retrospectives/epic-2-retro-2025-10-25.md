# Epic 2 Retrospective — Tracking Placeholder

Date: 2025-10-25
Facilitator: Bob (Scrum Master)

Epic: Epic 2 — Tracking Placeholder (Defer Full GA4 Integration)
Status: Complete (1/1 stories done)

## What Went Well
- Placeholder approach unblocked MVP and reduced scope risk
- Interfaces and flags (ENABLE_TRACKING) prepared a clean path for Epic 7

## What Could Improve
- Align validation (Epic 6) and debug/logging (Epic 5) earlier to avoid churn when enabling tracking later

## Key Lessons Learned
1. Use feature flags to stage non-MVP capabilities without shipping risk
2. Keep stubs and contracts stable to minimize rework

## Action Items (Owners)
- Document ENABLE_TRACKING usage in README (Dev)
- Cross-link Epic 7 stories in tracking stubs (Dev)

## Next Epic Preparation
- Next priorities: Epic 5 (observability) and Epic 6 (validation) before Epic 7
- No blockers from Epic 2; stubs ready to be replaced by Epic 7 implementations

## Metrics
- Stories Planned: 1
- Stories Done: 1
- Blockers: none
