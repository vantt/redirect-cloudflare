# Epic 1 Retrospective — Core Redirect Engine

Date: 2025-10-25
Facilitator: Bob (Scrum Master)

Epic: Epic 1 — Core Redirect Engine
Status: Complete (5/5 stories done)

## What Went Well
- Clear architectural foundations (Hono, Workers, KV) enabled rapid progress
- Strong alignment between PRD and implementation plan
- Tests and strict TypeScript improved confidence

## What Could Improve
- Earlier agreement on story storage paths would have reduced churn
- Consolidate validation/logging patterns early to avoid duplicate edits

## Key Lessons Learned
1. Enforce a single story location via config from day one
2. Stabilize error-handling and validation scaffolding before feature work
3. Keep sprint-status regeneration automated to avoid drift

## Action Items (Owners)
- Standardize story path and naming (SM) — complete
- Document global error JSON shape (Dev) — next epic
- Add contributor guide for testing patterns (Dev) — next epic

## Next Epic Preparation (Epic 2 → Placeholder; Epic 7 → Full Tracking)
- Dependencies: none blocking from Epic 1; redirect endpoint is stable
- Gaps: tracking stubs in place (2.1 Ready); full GA4 moved to Epic 7 (P1)
- Critical Path: finalize validation (6.1 Ready) before integrating tracking

## Metrics
- Stories Planned: 5
- Stories Done: 5
- Blockers: none persisted
