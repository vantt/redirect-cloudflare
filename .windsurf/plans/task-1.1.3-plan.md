# Task 1.1.3 Plan: Set Up Local Testing Infrastructure

## Task Overview
Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure for the Cloudflare Workers URL shortener project to ensure reliability, maintainability, and proper functionality.

## Prerequisites
- ✅ Task 1.1.1: Cloudflare Workers project initialization
- ✅ Task 1.1.2: Development environment configuration with Wrangler

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up Testing Framework
- [ ] Install and configure Vitest or Jest for unit testing
- [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration for tests
- [ ] Create test directory structure
- [ ] Configure test runner in package.json

### 2. Create Mock Environment
- [ ] Implement mock Cloudflare Worker environment
- [ ] Create mock Request/Response objects
- [ ] Set up environment variable mocking
- [ ] Create KV namespace mocking utilities

### 3. Implement Unit Tests
- [ ] Set up test fixtures for different URL patterns
- [ ] Create tests for URL parsing logic
- [ ] Create tests for redirect handling
- [ ] Create tests for edge cases (malformed URLs, etc.)

### 4. Set Up Integration Tests
- [ ] Configure Miniflare for local worker testing
- [ ] Create end-to-end test scenarios
- [ ] Implement test helpers for common operations

### 5. Configure Test Coverage Reporting
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting
- [ ] Configure minimum coverage thresholds
- [ ] Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline

### 6. Implement GitHub Actions Workflow (Optional)
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- [ ] Configure test reporting
- [ ] Set up deployment preview based on tests

## Success Criteria
- All unit tests passing with >90% code coverage
- Integration tests successfully running in local development
- Test commands documented in README
- Test infrastructure is scalable for future project growth

## Dependencies
- Vitest or Jest for unit testing
- Miniflare for local worker testing
- c8 or istanbul for code coverage

## Time Estimate
- 2-3 hours for initial setup
- 1-2 hours for implementing basic tests

## Notes
- Focus on testability from the beginning
- Ensure tests run quickly to enable rapid development
- Implement both positive and negative test cases
- Consider edge cases such as:
  - Malformed URLs
  - Missing hash fragments
  - Various URL encodings
  - Different redirect scenarios
