# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Phase 1: Core Infrastructure implementation
- Task 1.1.3: Set up local testing infrastructure

## Current State
- Memory Bank initialized with project details
- Project documentation reviewed and understood
- `.windsurfrules` file reviewed and understood
- Task 1.1.1 completed: Cloudflare Workers project initialized with TypeScript
- Task 1.1.2 completed: Development environment configured
- Plan for Task 1.1.3 created: Set up local testing infrastructure
- Task 1.1.3 completed: Set up local testing infrastructure

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Initialize Cloudflare Workers project (Task 1.1.1)
2. ✅ Configure development environment with Wrangler CLI (Task 1.1.2)
3. ✅ Set up local testing infrastructure (Task 1.1.3)
4. Set up KV storage (Task 1.1.4)
5. Implement basic request handling (Task 1.1.5)

## Open Tasks - Phase 1 Priority
- [x] Task 1.1.1: Initialize Cloudflare Workers project
- [x] Task 1.1.2: Configure development environment
- [x] Task 1.1.3: Set up local testing infrastructure
- [ ] Task 1.1.4: Set up KV storage
- [ ] Task 1.1.5: Implement basic request handling
- [ ] Task 1.2.1: Implement URL parsing logic
- [ ] Task 1.2.2: Add URL validation

## Key Considerations
- Follow URL structure specification: `https://redirect.example.com#[destination-url]?isNoRedirect=[0|1]`
- Processing time must be under 5ms
- Tracking must complete before redirection
- Error handling must be robust and graceful
- TypeScript implementation for better code quality
