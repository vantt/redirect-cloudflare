# Project Brief: Central Redirect Hub

## Overview
A centralized tracking hub that handles tracking (GTM/GA4) before performing redirections to destination URLs, built on Cloudflare Workers with edge computing.

## Goals
1. Process and redirect URLs while maintaining tracking integrity
2. Handle URL tracking parameters efficiently
3. Provide fast and reliable URL redirection (<5ms processing time)
4. Implement robust tracking and analytics mechanisms
5. Ensure secure, scalable, and maintainable redirection system

## Project Phases
1. Core Infrastructure - Basic worker setup, URL processing, redirect handling, error handling
2. Tracking Integration - GTM integration, GA4 tracking, parameter processing
3. Analytics Enhancement - Advanced tracking, dashboard, reporting, monitoring
4. Performance & Security - KV storage implementation, performance tuning, security hardening
5. Scalability & Documentation - Edge computing optimization, documentation

## Success Criteria
- Processing time < 5ms
- 100% uptime
- Zero tracking failures
- < 0.1% error rate
- Successful redirects with proper tracking
- Support for various platform-specific parameters
